    <h2 class="main">BROTHER'S OF DESTRUCTION</h2>  
    <p><b><h3>Brothers of Destruction: With growing belief and respect, Satwik and Chirag hungry for more glory</h3></b><br>
      Speaking to India Today, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty reflected on their dream season in 2023, their envious camaraderie, and the Paris Olympics dreams.<br> Satwik and Chirag won the Asian Games Gold and were ranked No.1 in men's doubles charts earlier in the year.
      Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty became the first Indian pair, across all three doubles categories, to be ranked No.1<br> in the world when they climbed two spots in the latest Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings released on Tuesday.
      Only three other Indians have had the privilege of being ranked No.1 in the world. Prakash Padukone was the first when he became the top ranked men’s singles shuttler in 1980. India had to wait another 35 years before delivering another world No.1 when Saina Nehwal claimed the top spot in 2015<br> just after becoming the only Indian women’s singles player to reach the All England Open Badminton Championships final.</p>

<p>Star Indian shuttlers Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty dished out another attacking masterclass to stand a step away from their second BWF Super 750 title after progressing to the men’s doubles final at the China Masters here on Saturday.<br>
   The former world No. 1 Indian pair, who had won their first BWF World Super 750 title at the French Open last year, notched up a 21-15 22-20 win over the newly-formed Chinese duo of He Ji Ting and Ren Xiang Yu in an explosive semi-final that lasted
  50 minutes.</p>
